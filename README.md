## 🕹️ Game Mechanics

### Core Gameplay
- Navigate a procedurally generated forest world
- Fight mobs to gain XP and coins
- Place and upgrade eight structure types across six visual tiers
- Click one of your structures to upgrade it alone or upgrade all owned structures of that type
- Join clans and parties
- Climb the leaderboard

### Building Tiers
- Source artwork lives in `tier1builds/` through `tier6builds/`
- `npm run build:assets` aligns the layered artwork and generates optimized WebP sprites in `buildassets/tier-sprites/`
- Structure tiers improve durability and their role-specific effect; server validation keeps multiplayer upgrades authoritative
- The upgrade panel supports desktop, mobile portrait, and mobile landscape layouts

### Player Progression
- 12 ranking tiers: Tohum → Tanrısal
- XP-based level progression
- Equipment upgrades
- Cosmetic skins and accessories

### Biomes
- Forest (spiders, basic mobs)
- Desert (scorpions, desert creatures)
- Snow (ice mobs, winter creatures)
- Swamp (poison creatures, swamp dwellers)
- Dark Forest (boss mobs, rare creatures)
